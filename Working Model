Agile Practice Group (APG) experimented with different working models. We started with one Scrum Team for every Scrum Master(SM) and later settled with 2 scrum teams for every SM.

One Scrum Team Model : 
Initially, when we had only 4 SMs. APG was in its early phase. We observed that, after big bang Agile Transformation, engineering team needed some time to settle down with new processes. They took some time to understand Agile and start following it.  We decided to have 1 SM per team. We allocated 4 SMs to 4 Scrum teams. There were many teams we havenâ€™t provide APG SM. They has their own SM from their development team. In his typical day SM was responsible for facilitating scrum ceremonies to team and coaching them. SMs were also working on different initiatives to make to make systemic changes in organization. More details on APG Initiatives in Chapter X. 

After Couple of releases, we observed that some teams were doing good on adapting agile practices and delivering value. Involvement and dependency on SM was reduced at that point of time. Organization also started seeing benefits of having APG SM for scrum team. Scrum teams with APG team were having Scrum ceremonies lot better than teams without APG SM.
